By default it just runs the core, which makes the bot idle in one or more channels on a server. It will also log all events in those channels to log files. The bot depends on modules for its actual functionality.\r\n\r\nCurrently the following modules come with RE_HeufyBot:\r\n\r\nRecommended modules:\r\n\r\n- ModuleLoader\r\n- Help\r\n- Ignore\r\n\r\nOptional modules:\r\n\r\n- Choose\r\n- Do\r\n- Join\r\n- Log\r\n- Nick\r\n- OutOfContext\r\n- Part\r\n- Quit\r\n- Say\r\n- Shorten\r\n- Source\r\n- Tell\r\n- Time\r\n- Translate\r\n- TranslationParty\r\n- Weather\r\n- YouTube\r\n\r\nDetials about how to write your own module can be found here: https://github.com/Heufneutje/RE_HeufyBot/blob/master/src/heufybot/modules/Module.java\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
